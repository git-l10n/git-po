# Git Attributes for PO Files
#
# This file configures Git filters to automatically strip location information
# from PO files when committing, producing cleaner diffs and saving repository
# space.
#
# Two filter types are used:
# 1. gettext-no-file-no-location: Strips both filenames and line numbers
#    (e.g., removes "#: main.c:123" entirely)
# 2. gettext-no-location: Preserves filenames but removes line numbers, which
#    requires gettext 0.20 or higher
#    (e.g., "#: main.c:123" becomes "#: main.c")
#
# See `po/README.md` for instructions on setting up the required filter drivers.

# Default: Strip both filenames and locations for all .po files
*.po	filter=gettext-no-file-no-location

# Explicitly documented languages using the default filter
# (These inherit the *.po rule above but are listed here for documentation)
